TODO
------------
* Update disassembly approach
  - Ideas for the global analyser
    - If symbols are available process them
    - Then start at the entry point and recursively disassemble CALLs 
      (we may do this anyway even if symbols are available. we will just get the same info)
    - This will eventually produce a good map of available functions
    - Also process jumps so we get full code coverage... 
      * problem with dynamic jumps (jmp [REGISTER]). 
  - Disassemble on demand.
    - Run local analysis for the memory area to process
      * Maybe just create labels on the flight for just that disaseemble???
    - Then disassemble that area and dump it
    - Maybe store data for functions so we retrieve all the data
      when visiting them back
* Process functions
  - Identify local vars
  - Deterine beginning and end
  - Cross reference info?
* Process globals (Can be added as symbols) [PARTIAL]

DONE
-------------------
* Add user comments
* Save/Load SREP files (STAN Reverse Engineering Projects :)
